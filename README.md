# EDD Calculator App (Prototype)

This repository contains the **first prototype** of an **EDD (Expected Delivery Date) Calculator** mobile application built using **Flutter**.

This prototype was developed during my **internship phase** as part of a **health program initiative**, where the goal was to digitize and streamline pregnancy-related data collection and calculations.

The **production-ready version** of this application has since evolved further and is currently live on the **Google Play Store** under the organization’s ecosystem.  
This repository represents the **initial technical and functional foundation** of that system.
